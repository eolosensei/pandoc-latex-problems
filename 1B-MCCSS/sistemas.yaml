# Filters will be assumed to be Lua filters if they have
# the .lua extension, and json filters otherwise.  But
# the filter type can also be specified explicitly, as shown.
# Filters are run in the order specified.
# To include the built-in citeproc filter, use either `citeproc`
# or `{type: citeproc}`.
